This project contains code to make multiple parallel calls to CSE API. It colates those results and returns a single
JSON response.

To use it you will need a keys.py file with the cse_id and api_key.

Deploy it like any other cloud project.

To call the API:

<URL>/api?q="kitchen faucet brushed nickel"

You can also try out the HTML search from
<URL>/

example app engine:
